/**
 * Render a terminal's captured output (the ⌘M "markdown of output" view) to sanitized HTML.
 *
 * `renderMarkdown` is the wrong tool for this, for three measured reasons:
 * - With `breaks: false`, consecutive output lines join into ONE paragraph — `ls -l` rendered as a
 *   single run-on line. Terminal output is line-oriented, so every newline is kept (`breaks: true`).
 * - Anything that LOOKS like a tag is parsed as raw HTML, and DOMPurify then strips it:
 *   `echo <stdin>` showed as `echo `. Output is text a program printed, never markup the user
 *   meant, so raw-HTML tokens are rendered as escaped TEXT. This is done on the `html` token only —
 *   NOT by pre-escaping `<` in the source, which would double-escape inside code spans/fences
 *   (marked already escapes those, so `a < b` in backticks would print as `a &lt; b`).
 * - `tmux capture-pane` pads the capture with trailing blank lines (and lines with trailing
 *   spaces), which rendered as a tall empty tail under the real output.
 *
 * A private `Marked` instance, so the global `marked` config that `renderMarkdown`'s callers
 * (sticky notes, editor preview, ChatPanel) share is never touched. The result still goes through
 * DOMPurify: escaping raw HTML is about readability, sanitizing is about safety — markdown links
 * (`[x](javascript:…)`) still produce real elements that need it.

 * view showed `[38;5;153m` around every coloured word. A local capture has no `-e` and is unchanged.
 * CSI (`ESC [ … final`), OSC (`ESC ] … BEL|ESC \`) and the two-byte ESC forms are removed, then any
 * C0/C1 control other than tab and newline. Each pattern is linear: no nested quantifiers.
