/**
 * Settings → License wording, derived from the data in ONE place so a sentence cannot promise
 * something the numbers do not say.
 *
 * Three facts shape the branches below:
 *
 * 1. **A reason code is either about the LICENSE or about the CALL, and both arrive in the same
 *    `error` field.** A refused RELEASE (`too_soon` | `not_applicable`) is about the license: it
 *    rides on top of the LAST GOOD read, so its key, source and counts are real, and it belongs
 *    beside them. Everything else — `unauthorized` | `inactive` | `offline` | `disabled` |
 *    `network` — is about a call that did not deliver, and the route it failed on decides what to
 *    say: on a READ it means the key and counts are unknown, on a RELEASE it means the action did
 *    not happen (and, offline, may or may not have). The store therefore never merges a release's
 *    transport failure onto `detail` (it hands the code back instead), and `releaseFailureSentence`
 *    is the one place that speaks for it. `isReleaseRefusal` is the shared split so the store and
 *    the panel cannot disagree about which family a code is in.
 * 2. **"Your Pro access is unaffected" is a forward-looking promise, so only codes that back it may
 *    say it.** `offline`/`network`/`disabled` mean we could not look — the entitlement is verified
 *    locally and nothing changed. `inactive`/`unauthorized` are ANSWERS that this license is not in
 *    good standing, and the very next refresh may drop Pro; telling that user they are unaffected
 *    is the same class of lie as rendering a placeholder zero as a device count.
 * 3. **Seats and devices are the same thing by design**, so the copy says "devices" and names
 *    phones explicitly — a paired phone holds a seat too, and a user who does not know that reads
 *    the cap as broken.
